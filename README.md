# E-Commerce-

What was my goal?


My task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Youâ€™ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.


What I learned?

How to use mysql, sequilize, express together to build my application. Using foregin keys to build by relationships. Getting more experience in builing routes and models. More experince using JavaScript. More experince using insomnia.
